<p><strong>Evolution of Orthopaedic training examination in UK</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The old-style FRCS: Until late 1970s.</li>
<li>MCh(Orth) from the University of Liverpool: Now obsolete</li>
<li>OPTIONAL Specialty Fellowship exam in orthopaedics in 1979.</li>
<li>A new intercollegiate exam was introduced in 1990, which was accepted by all four Royal Colleges.</li>
<li>In 1991 FRCS became a requirement for accreditation.</li>
<li>The four Surgical Royal Colleges (Edinburgh, England, Glasgow &amp; Ireland) in 2015 introduced a new suite of Intercollegiate Fellowship Examinations for the international surgical community.</li>
<li>The JSCFE has parity of standard with the existing UK/Ireland Intercollegiate Fellowship. Examinations and is recognised by GMC for Speciality registration.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Examination Pattern<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#examination-pattern"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The current International FRCS (Tr &amp; Orth) exam encompasses two sections: Part I is a written exam and Part II the clinical and oral exam. For further information, and to make sure that your information is up to date, I suggest that you carefully review the Intercollegiate Speciality Board website.
<a href="http://www.jscfe.org.uk">This is the link</a>.</p>
<div id="part-i" class="section level5" number="1.1.1.0.1">
<h5>
<span class="header-section-number">1.1.1.0.1</span> Part I<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#part-i"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h5>
<p>This section consists of two separate papers ( a Computer Based Testing-CBT); essentially, a multiple-choice question (MCQ) paper (2 Hours) and an extended matching question (EMQ) paper (2 hours 30 minutes). Part I is generally regarded as the easier section of exam to pass. A number of candidates may be OK learning for an MCQ/EMI paper but be a long way off the standard for a clinical and viva exam.</p>
<p>Format of Section 1 examination changes from 2021</p>
<p>The GMC has approved an alteration to the format of the Section 1 examination. The following format is applicable to all Section 1 examinations from January 2021:</p>
<p>Paper 1 – 120 Single Best [SBA] (2 hours 15 mins)</p>
<p>Paper 2 – 120 Single Best [SBA] (2 hours 15 mins)</p>
<p>How to apply</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jscfe.co.uk" class="uri">https://www.jscfe.co.uk</a> is the official website for registering and applying for the examination. It costs £520.00 for Part I application and £1,785.00 for Part II. To apply,</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Applicants must be six years medically qualified</li>
<li>Applicants would normally have passed the MRCS examination of one ofthe four Surgical Royal Colleges but this is currently not mandatory</li>
<li>Applicants must have successfully completed a locally recognised surgical training programme and are required to provide evidence of having achieved the required standard of a recognised specialist (day one NHS UK/Ireland consultant standard) in the generality of Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery</li>
<li>This evidence must consist of three structured references as follows:</li>
<li>The principal referee must be the applicant’s current of Head of Department or Head of the Recognised Training Committee/Programme in which the applicant has participated.</li>
<li>The second referee must be a senior clinician who has worked with the applicant and has knowledge of the applicant’s work in his/her specialty within the last two years</li>
<li>The third referee must be a senior clinician who has worked with the applicant and has knowledge of the applicant’s work in his/her specialty within the last two years</li>
<li>The final decision on eligibility for admission to the examination will lie with the Joint Surgical Colleges Fellowship Examination Specialty Board in Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery</li>
<li>Examination Attempts:<br>
Candidates will have up to a maximum of 7 years to complete the examination process as follows:<br><strong>Section 1</strong>:Candidates will have a maximum of 4 attempts with no re-entry<br><strong>Section 2</strong>:Candidates will have a maximum of 4 attempts with no re-entry</li>

<span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Preparing for Part I<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#preparing-for-part-i"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Like any other thing in life, there are multiple paths for Part I preparation. Rather than enumerating, I would describe what worked out for me. I believe that, at least 5 months of intense preparation is necessary before you can confidently appear for Part I. Focused preparation begins after the successful submission of application. So, before paying the exam fees, make sure that at least 5-6 months are left for the preparation. It is a good first to answer all the Orthobullets questions to get an idea of where you stand. My score was 40%. I bought Miller’s Review of Orthopaedics and started learning. I spent nearly 5-6 hours reading Miller/attempting Orthobullets questions. My strategy was to read Miller as much as I can and as quickly as possible so as to revise at-least 3-4 times. My strategy for Orthobullets questions was similar. My target was 150-200 questions per day, with 3-4 revisions before exam. 1 month before the Part I exam, I bought paid questions in the Orthobullets and BMJ OnExamination which I believe, though expensive, gave me an extra edge and confidence.</p>

</h3>
<p>Just like any other examination in the past, I reached the city 1 day prier to the exam date. I stayed at a decent 4-star hotel which was located at a walkable distance from the Pearson VUE test Centre. My exam was in the afternoon. I woke up at 6 am. My plan was to brush through the entire Miller before noon, which I did. This gave me a fresh confidence. Had a nice meal and I packed some food to the exam hall.</p>
<p>I consciously abstained from reading/talking anything related to exam from there. Luckily I knew no-one in the exam hall, so I could escape to one corner in the waiting area. I read lightly from my Kindle something other than Orthopaedics and relaxed.</p>
<p>An official checked our passport and gave a brief introduction. I kept all my belongings in to a designated locker, including my mobile after switching off. I was escorted to the test area, and after frisking, was given a pen and a paper for rough work and was taken to the CBT console. Total duration of the exam was 5 hours (2 hours SBA, 2 hours 30 minutes EMQ, 30 minutes break in between). During the break, I was allowed to open the locker, take out my packed food and eat from the waiting area. There were no refreshments provided except for drinking water. The topics/questions I could remember are summarised here</p>
<div id="the-paper" class="section level4" number="1.2.2.1">
<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">1.2.2.1</span> The paper<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-paper"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>My plan was to see all the questions as quickly as possible and mark the sure shot answers. Then I came back and spent some time on questions which demanded some pondering. Then I came back again to reconsider and review the already answered questions. The flagged questions, the answers of which were not known to me were then reviewed and made some educated guesses. Luckily, still I felt as if I had lot of time.</p>

<p>The result came as an email from the CHAIR, JSCFE SPECIALTY BOARD IN TRAUMA &amp; ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY exactly 20 days after the examination. It also included the breakdown of the result. Mean minimum score required to proceed to Part II was 61.46%. My mean score was 73.39%.</p>

</h2>
<p>During the 3 weeks waiting period, I made some internet search and made a tentative plan for Part II preparation, in case I could clear the exam. I was equally thinking about mentally preparing myself to resit the Part I ( Though I had no clue about alternative preparation method or my ability to stretch beyond the limits of my initial preparation). It later turned out to be good 1 year gap for the preparation.My plan for Part II can be summarised as below.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Attend preparatory course<br>
</li>
<li>Buy clinical and viva study materials</li>
<li>Take classes for residents</li>
<li>Standardise the clinical examination method See as much patients as I can</li>
<li>Make notes for quick revision<br>

<p>I stumbled upon and intuitively selected two courses, which turned out to be real gems in due course,</p>
<div id="postgraduate-orthopaedics-revision-course-by-postgraduate-orthopaedics" class="section level5" number="1.3.1.0.1">

</h5>
<p>This is an intense 6 day course covering all the A list/core topics for Part II. I attended the course twice. One in the very beginning of the Part II preparation and another at the end of my preparation to “iron out my technique”, just before exam. The course helped in two fronts; first it helped me to develop a systems approach and secondly it grilled in the concept of <strong>“Higher order thinking”</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-frcs-mentor-network-offline-youtube-videos-1" class="section level5" number="1.3.1.0.4">

</h5>
<p>Shwan and Firas Arnaout are doing wonderful work in preparing candidates through online group. I regularly listened to their youtube uploads, and believe that this really helped me in developing confidence and foresee the real clinical and viva stations. FRCS mentor group some how introduced me to another gem, videos by Quen Tang.</p>

<p>During the last 2-3 mo

<span class="header-section-number">1.3.4</span> The Clinical and viva<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-clinical-and-viva"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>

<p>As usual I reached well in advance before the exam, in fact 2 days earlier. I stayed in the same hotel where viva was supposed to be conducted. Unfortunately, I developed allergic rhinitis and was really worried.</p>
</div>
<div id="clinicals-day-1" class="section level3" number="1.3.5">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.3.5</span> Clinicals, Day 1<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#clinicals-day-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>

<p>I felt quite distracted by the rhinitis and the fellow candidates, with lot of speculative discussions in the air both in the hotel and in the exam hall. I tried not to get carried away and keep focused. I had the short cases first and had to be really on my toes and time fled like anything. My performance was pretty average or possibly bad in 2 stations. Luckily the rhinitis did not come in the way.I tried to forget those stations and tried to focus myself before the intermediate case, sitting away from fellow noisy candidates. I practiced structured history taking by writing down individual questions for standard patient interrogation. In the intermediate case station (PLIF patient with foot drop), I felt more confident and was able to control the situation to a large extend.</p>
</div>
<div id="viva-day-2" class="section level3" number="1.3.6">

<p>Viva was in the morning, but I had lot of time with out any distraction before that. I could revise my entire notes before viva. I could remain focused. Only problem was dry cough, which I tried to ignore. All the questions were familiar to me and I controlled the discussion to a great extend except in the basic science station. There I performed rather poorly, but my overall performance was good.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">1.3.7</span> Dress code<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#dress-code"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>

<p>Of course there is no dress code for Part I. For the clinicals, the principle is to be bare below the elbow. Tie is not mandatory. But I preferred to wear one with the end tucked into the Light blue shirt. I wore dark blue trousers and black formal shoes. You are expected to wear a suit for the viva. I wore a dark blue one and a white shirt. The board expects you and only you for the examination. This means no need to carry any examination kit.</p>

<p>We have the entire Orthopaedic knowledge available online through the wonderful platform of Orthobullets . We have got standard textbooks like Campbell’s Operative Orthopaedics, Apley’s system of Orthopaedics and Fractures and many more. Our teachers are excellent and they teach their experience in orthopaedics passionately. However, the overall pass percentage(starting from 2009) for Part 1 is around 68% and for the Part 2 it is a little below 60%. Theoretically, after forking out more than £ 2ooo, the possibility of yourself passing both parts in a single attempt is around 40%. This is even lower for International examination. Why it is so?There could be many potential reasons.</p>
<p>Here we will try to stick on to only the critical decision of choosing the study materials in the form of textbooks or online resources. The choice of study material is down to individual preference. Some prefer textbooks while others choose to use websites. Two of my friends claim to pass the Part 1 after studying only Orthobullets question. This could be entirely possible, but I cannot understand how. Hence I here-by label them as outliers!</p>
<p>Like anything else in life, choosing the right resource at the right time is critical, if you want to pass an examination like FRCS(Tr&amp;Orth). It is considered a very difficult examination, where the candidates are tested for the <strong>knowledge</strong> and <strong>understanding</strong> of a wide range of orthopaedic problems. Reading “standard” textbooks and journals may not be enough for passing the examination. The most commonly mentioned prerequisites are <strong>higher order thinking</strong> , <strong>communication skill</strong> and <strong>confidence</strong>. Here I would like to review some of the outstanding books and online resources which could be a potential resource(s) for your success.</p>

<p>Orthobullet’s questions are the first possible starting point for anybody who wants to assess oneself. It will also help you to get into the groove. At this point temptation to memorize the entire Orthobullets by heart is a real risk, which I believe, is better to resist. Orthobullets provide explanations at the end of each of the questions, stick on to that. and you can also monitor your progress easily, and that too for free. Though American in origin, most of the topics on which questions are created seem relevant to British exam.</p>

<p>The previous candidate experience given in the website could be a refresher for those who have successfully completed the Part 1 and not yet started serious Part 2 preparation.Whether one should register for the paid questions is doubtful.

<p>From a plethora of expensive Orthopaedic textbooks of varying size, shape and quality, it is difficult to select a perfect book or two. <strong>It is better to acknowledge the fact that the nature of the exam is diverse and there is no quick and easy remedy.</strong></p>

</h3>
<p>Coming with a punchy tag line, <em>go-to certification and recertification review guide for every orthopaedic resident, fellow, and surgeon</em>, this book divides people in to two-<strong>Those who believe in Miller’s review and those who do not!</strong> It’s strong point is compactness and intensiveness; same is its weakness. It’s basic science, Arthroplasty and Statistics chapters are industry standard. I cleared the Part 1 <strong>studying</strong> mainly(95%) Miller and Orthobullet question bank. If allowed to grade as per FRCS Part 2 marking system, I will give 7/8 for this book when used for <strong>Part 1</strong>. Its usefulness for Part 2 as an exclusive guide is at the best doubtful. I cannot comment on the more recent 8^th edition.</p>

<p>Selection of Part 2 book is relatively simpler. This book series stands apart. I doubt whether you can pass the Part 2 without going through these 2 books. Apart from the top class content, they drill in <strong>higher order thinking</strong> and caters to even more advanced students of orthopaedics. It is impossible to grade this book. <strong>Prof. Paul Banaszkiewicz has done a work of genius.</strong></p>

<p>Let’s try to learn a topic from these two books: <strong>Funnel plot</strong></p>
<p><strong>Miller’s Review 7^th edition</strong>: The topic is not covered.</p>
<div id="postgraduate-orthopaedics" class="section level4" number="1.5.3.1">

<span class="header-section-number">1.5.3.1</span> Postgraduate Orthopaedics:<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#postgraduate-orthopaedics"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Both Candidate’s guide and the viva guide beautifully discusses the funnel plot. Let me quote a few lines from them.</p>
<div id="candidates-guide" class="section level5" number="1.5.3.1.1">
<h5>
<span class="header-section-number">1.5.3.1.1</span> Candidates guide<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#candidates-guide"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>“Funnel plots are used to compare outcomes in groups of different sizes. It was seen in the section on SEM that with increasing sample size the SEM approaches zero; where this does not occur it is likely that some effect is being observed. This can be used to detect ‘ outliers ’*</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In outcome studies, such as when comparing mortality rates for different surgical centres or surgeons <strong>Inverted funnel plots can be used to detect publication bias</strong>; the SEM should be larger for studies with smaller sample sizes – If it is not this may indicate publication bias. ……….; if there is an effect of the intervention there will be a shift of the data points to the left but there should still be a greater scatter of results for the studies with a larger SEM. The plot on the left shows no such increase in scatter with increasing SEM, suggesting publication bias(two funnel plots are shown)”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="viva-guide" class="section level5" number="1.5.3.1.2">
<h5>
<span class="header-section-number">1.5.3.1.2</span> Viva Guide<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#viva-guide"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>“This is called a funnel plot which is a simple scatterplot of the treatment effects (RR) estimated from individual studies (horizontal axis) against the precision of the studies represented by standard error (SE). The vertical dotted line shows the estimated combined RR from the meta-analysis. The diagonal dotted lines show the range in which studies might be distributed by chance given the size (and thus precision) of each study. Thus larger (big sample size), more precise (smaller standard error) studies should be closely distributed either side of the pooled effect and smaller studies should be distributed more widely giving the classic inverted symmetrical funnel. If the studies are not distributed randomly (due to sampling error) around the combined RR estimate then some other influence is suggested. The funnel plot shows trials scattered asymmetrically around the pooled RR with smaller trials reporting a greater effect than larger ones. Two possible explanations are: smaller trials of lower methodological quality tend to overestimate true effect; publication bias has led to the smaller negative trials remaining unpublished.”
You would appreciate the difference the moment you read a lesser book.</p>

<p>Recently Firas Arnaout of FRCS Mentor group contacted me and suggested me to read his recently revised book, <strong>Concise Orthopaedic Notes </strong>. He kindly gave me free assess to the digital version. I thank him for the gesture, even though, as a kindle unlimited member, I had already rented and read some chapters of his book before.
Authors believe that they have covered the depth and width of knowledge and skills required for the exam and challenge anyone to find an FRCS question that has not been included in the book. This book is a welcome edition and with some hard work, it can even compete with Miller’s review to some extent, <em>for <strong>Part 1</strong>.</em></p>
<p>Let’s see what does the book tell us about funnel plot.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Performance measuring tool used to measure variations in performance between surgeons and/or centres and identify outliers (Above red line)</li>
<li>They are scatter plots, with superimposed control limits (typically 2 SD, 3 SD or 4 SD)</li>
<li>Shows 90-day mortality following hip surgery</li>
<li>Surgeon/hospital highlighted as orange triangle</li>
<li>The smaller the size of the sample, the wider the control limits (increased variability).</li>
<li>As the sample increases the certainty increases and the ‘funnel’ is formed.</li>
<li>Progression along horizontal axis means that surgeon/hospital done more cases</li>
<li>Data within the control limits (between the dotted lines) are consistent with common cause variation or natural variation, whereas those outside these limits indicate unexpected good or bad results (outliers)</li>
<li>For mortality, it means they done higher risk patients</li>
<li>Can’t identify someone doing very few cases (towards left side of graph) as outlier.</li>
<li>Progression along vertical axis means surgeon/hospital have had more of the end point (revision or death) deaths.</li>
<li>Vertical axis figures presented as standardized ratio.</li>
<li>For mortality - data adjusted to take account of surgeons who operate on more higher-risk or lower-risk patients.</li>
<li>Surgeons on central (green) horizontal line have had exactly average expected mortality.</li>
<li>Surgeons either side of green line but below upper red line have level of mortality that is within expected range.</li>
<li>Surgeons that appear above top red line have mortality rate higher than expected. This is followed by a picture of funnel plot.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>After reading this I am more confused than confident</strong></p>
