## Charcot

#### Definition

<font color="emerald">It is a non infectious,destructive process culminating in dislocations and periarticular fractures in patients with peripheral neuropathy and loss of protective sensations</font>

0.1 to 29% incidence

50% need one operation in life time

15-67% chance of amputation

#### Clinical features

-   Pain
-   Local rise of temparature >3-5<sup>0</sup> compared to normal
-   Swelling
-   Deformity

#### Cahrcot vs Infection

| Charcor                               | Infection                                  |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Limb elevation decreases inflammation | No                                         |
| No                                    | Increased ESR,CRP,IL6                      |
| No                                    | Istope (In +Tc)scan positive, PET positive |

#### Classification

##### Eichenholtz

| Stage | Name             | Features                |
|-------|------------------|-------------------------|
| 0     | Prefragmentation | Inflammation            |

| 2     | Coalascence      | decreased inflammation  |
| 3     | Consolidation    | No inflammation         |

#### Progression

0-1 in 6 months and 2-3 in 12-14 months

#### Causes

-   Endocrine: DM, Renal failure, Alcohol
-   Infection: Leprosy, syphilis
-   Neurogenic: CP, Syrinx,Myelomeningocele, cord injury
-   Idiopathic

#### Theories

-   Neurotraumatic
-   Neurovascular ( **Autonomic dysfunction causing bone resorption**)
-   Inflammatory theory (**Favored, Here injury lead to inflammation and activate RANK-RANKL pathway leading to bone resorption**)
-   ADA, 2011 suggests a hybrid of all theories

#### Clinical examination

##### Look

Stand the patient and look for deformity. Most common are **Rocker bottom and Planovalgus**

Walk the patient and look for Clawing and also have a look at the foot wear

Sit the patient and look for deformity, ulceration and inflammation

##### Feel

Temperature, tenderness, pulse and sensation

##### Move

The joints

##### Special tests

SilfverskiÃ¶ld test, Vibration, **offer probing the ulcer**

#### management principles

1.  Stop inflammation
2.  Protect and maintain foot architecture
3.  Relieve pain
4.  Arrest or reverse de-mineralisation
5.  Prevent/limit deformity
6.  Control DM

> Suspect Charcot if there is a deformity associated with inflammation, perepheral neuropathy with or without renal failure

> Suspected a/c Charcot: always take a weight bearing X Ray, if negative take MRI

> Immediatly refer to MDT

#### MDT approach

1.  Non removable offloading device
2.  **No Bisphosphonates**
3.  Monitor by Foot Skin temperature assessment and seriel xrays until inflammation resolves

#### When will you say that inflammation is resolved?

-   Temperature difference of \< $2^0$ between the feet
-   Seriel xrays show no progression

## Diabetic foot

Diabetes is a systemic disease which causes - Neuropathy - Vasculopathy - Ulceration - Deformities

Hence it requires a MDT approach for diabetic treatment. This include <font color = "diamond">Hospital based MDT and Community based foot protection service</font>

#### Assessment

1.  How well the diabetes is controlled: **HBA**<sub>1</sub>C

2.  Presence of neuropathy

    -   Motor: **Deformities, intrinsic minus, weak TibAnt, MT head pressure**
    -   Sensory: Loss of protective sensation (10g S-W monofilament, vibration 128hz)
    -   Autonomic: Dry skin, nail changes,increased vascular response to trauma

3.  Presence of Vasculitis

    -   ABPI >0.45 and triphasic flow in dopplar
    -   TrC-O<sub>2</sub> >30
    -   Absolute toe pressure >40 mmHg
    -   Pulse

4.  Presence of Ulceration

    -   Ulceration could be either infected or non infected. In all ulcers, we have to rule out ischemia (vascular ulcer) and Neuropathy.

5.  Deformities

#### Management

1.  **General**: Prevention, education and accomodative foot wear.
2.  Ulcer management It depends on whether the ulcer is infected or not.

##### Uninfected ulcer manaagement

if the ulcer is uninfected we should be first differentiate wheter it is neuropathic or vascular ulcer.

<font color = "emerald"> Neuropathic ulcers

-   Seen under the metatarsal heads
-   Punched out
-   Painless
-   Healthy granulation
-   Pulse will be present
-   There will be loss of vibration sensation </font>

Treatment is Total Contact Cast followed by accomodative footwear.

<font color="blue"> Vascular ulcers

-   Seen any where
-   Painful
-   Pulse may be absent</font>

Requires vascular team assessment for angioplasty/bipass. This will be followed by TCC and accomodative foot wear

##### Infected ulcer management

If the ulcer is ischemic, it should be managed by vascular team

Otherwise, the local hospital team will be managing and that range from appropriate antibiotics as per culture to Amputation.

#### Deformity management

##### A/C presentations that need surgery

-   Medical dislocation of T-N joint causing plano valgus deformity
-   Dorsal dislocation of T-N joint causing lateral rocker bottom
-   Infection requiring drainage/sepsis
-   Ischemia/gangrene

##### Chronic deformities

###### Principles

-   prolonged non weight bearing (4 months) followed by protected weight bearing
-   TCC/Accomodative foot wear is the main stay treatment
-   prefer arthrodesis over ORIF

## Tuberculosis of Locomotor system

Out of the total population of patients with tuberculosis, if we forget the less important organs like head, chest and abdomen, the subset of people with locomotor system TB comes to about 1-2%. Of this 50% is spinal, 15% hip and 10% knee. Rest of the patients will have other joint area or bone involvement.

They are predominantly paucibacillary type, meaning, the chances of you finding mycobacteria in specimens is near unlikely. That make the diagnosis difficult and treatment trouble-sum.

#### Diagnosis

My approach to diagnosis is PaTeNDed.

-   Pa-Pain

-   Te-Tenderness

-   N-Neurology

-   Ded-Deformity

Particular problem is with pain. Almost all patients come to an orthopaedic surgeon for pain. Our task is to filter out a small portion of organic pain from a big collection of mechanical and somatic pains. One useful rule of thumb is

> *organic pains increase after a period of rest and are most often associated with rest pain and night pain*

The moment we see such a patient, and especially if associated with localised tenderness, subtle neurological findings or deformity, we have to think about 3 potential diseases

1.  Malignancy

2.  Infection

3.  Inflammatory diseases

We should always suspect TB in that situation.

TB spine can be

-   Para-diskal -->Arterial spread (most common)

-   Central --> Venous

-   Anterior-->Sub-periosteal

-   Posterior-->Unstable (rare)

Taking a baseline xray is the first investigation we can quickly do. ESR and CRP has got prognostic values. Contrast enhanced MRI, preferably Gadolinium is the best screening test available. If the MRI picture is suggesting infection, take a biopsy under CT guidance. The specimen should be sent for

1.  HPE

2.  Mycobacterium and other cultures

3.  NAAT test

4.  Staining

#### NAAT

Specimen for NAAT should be sent in sterile container, in saline if there is chance of drying. There should be 2 specimens.

CB-NAAT (Cartridge based) and TRU-NAAT (Card based) are the two types of tests available. Both are recognised by WHO and NTEP for diagnosis of TB. One important point is that the specimen should not contain blood or urine, which can reduce the sensitivity of the test. Overall solid tissue is preferred over liquid. The test, apart from diagnosis, helps in identifying **Rifampicin** sensitivity. If the speciment is resistant to RIF, send the second sample for Genotypic/phenotypic drug resistant test. LPA (line probe analysis) is a rapid test and can be employed to detect resistance against first and second line drugs.

#### Culture

The culture medium of choice is MGIT (Mycobacterium Growth detection Tube). It is prone for contamination, but yields result in 2-4 weeks. But always co-culture in LJ medium to mitigate the problem of contamination.

#### HPE

Pathologists look for

-   Epitheloid cells

-   Granuloma

-   Lymphocytic infiltration

#### Treatment

-   ATT- 2HREZ + 10-16 HRE (16 for spine)

-   Immobilisation

-   Surgery

#### Indications for surgery

1.  Neurological complications, especially worsening with medical management

2.  Non neurological complications

Non neurological complications that may warrant surgery include

-   M- Mass effect, mechanical instability

-   D-Deformity

-   R-Resistance

Tuli classification of Neurology

1.  Not aware of weakness

2.  Aware of weakness

3.  In extension

4.  In flexion

#### Follow-up

-   Weekly- Assessment of neurology

-   3 monthly- X-Rays

-   6 monthly- MRI

-   Follow-up up to 2 years after completion of treatment

## Osteoporosis

#### Definition

Decrease in bone mass with micro architectural deterioration
